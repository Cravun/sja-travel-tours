      `Bohol is one of the top Visayas tourist destinations and top tourist attractions in the Philippines that merits international attention. 
      It is well-known for being the location of the famed Chocolate Hills and Tarsier sanctuaries. 
      Bohol also has some of the top honeymoon resorts and beach resorts in the Philippines, making it an excellent Boracay alternative. 
      But many visitors are unaware that it is also a refuge of nature's treasures, fortunate in all things ecological. To balance things out, 
      Bohol has a rich history as the birthplace of our country's Christianization.`,
