      `The Taal Lake, also known as Talisay Lake and Bomb√≥n Lake, is a
      circular fresh water lake located in the Province of Batangas, in
      Southern Luzon, a remarkable haven for tourists both local and
      foreign, for its alluring and majestic view. It is nestled on the
      mountainous ridge of Batangas that forms a part of the caldera and
      home to almost 39,000 peace-loving and God-fearing people. At the
      lake, you can board a Filipino-made motorized outrigger boat and
      enjoy a 30-minute ride across the lake to the village of Talisay on
      Volcano Island.`,
